# 📋 Manual Repository Creation Guide

## 🎯 Please Create the GitHub Repository Manually

Since GitHub API requires authentication, please follow these simple steps to create the repository:

### 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open your web browser** and go to: **https://github.com**
2. **Sign in** to your GitHub account (`olaitanojo`)
3. **Click the "+" icon** in the top-right corner
4. **Select "New repository"**
5. **Fill in the repository details:**

```
Repository Name: ci-cd-pipelines

Description: Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline configurations for all GitHub repositories with advanced deployment strategies, security scanning, and GitOps workflows

Visibility: ✅ Public (recommended) or Private (your choice)

❌ DO NOT check "Add a README file"
❌ DO NOT check "Add .gitignore" 
❌ DO NOT check "Choose a license"

(We already have these files!)
```

6. **Click "Create repository"**

### ✅ After Creating the Repository:

**Return to this terminal** and I'll automatically push all your CI/CD configurations and run the distribution script!

**Just let me know when you've created the repository by typing "done" or "ready"**

**⏱️ This should take less than 2 minutes!**
